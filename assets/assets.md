# Assets Folder

Contains static assets used across the site: images, icons and other media.

Files and folders
- `Content/` : project images and icons used by the public site (hero images, thumbnails). Check file names before referencing from pages.
- `Sample img-1.png` : example image used in prototypes.

Notes
- Keep image paths consistent with templates (`/assets/Content/...`).
- Optimize large images for web (resize, compress) to reduce load times.
